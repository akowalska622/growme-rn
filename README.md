## Project overview

### Motivation and context

The project was started by two amateur garden enthusiasts, [@akowalska622](https://github.com/akowalska622) and [@weronikaolejniczak](https://github.com/weronikaolejniczak). We love plants and programming, and wanted to join these hobbies in an interesting project. We both work as full-time web developers but we like to expand our knowledge and give ourselves some challenges! ðŸ˜Š

### Features

- Authentication and authorization through Firebase.
- Creating plant collections.
- Adding, editing and deleting plants from collections.
- Watering and fertilization schedules.
- Plant wishlist.

Maybe some more in the future! :D

### Technology stack

- **React Native** with Expo build
- **Redux** for managing application's state
- integration with **Firebase** for authentication, authorization and data persistance

Maybe some **Express** backend application in the future.
